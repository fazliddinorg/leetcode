# LeetCode Solutions by Patterns

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode problems**, organized by **solution patterns**.
The goal of this project is to build a structured reference of problem-solving techniques that can be reused across different problems.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Problems are grouped into directories based on the algorithmic pattern or technique used:

* **Two Pointers**
* **Sliding Window**
* **Fast & Slow Pointers**
* **Hash Map / Hash Set**
* **Binary Search**
* **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
* **Backtracking**
* **Dynamic Programming**
* **Greedy**

Each folder contains Python solutions (`.py`) with clear function implementations and comments.

---

## 🛠️ Features

* Categorized solutions for easier navigation.
* Clean and beginner-friendly code style.
* Uses **Python 3**.
* Problem files are named after the corresponding **LeetCode problem** (e.g., `two_sum.py`).

---

## 🚀 Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fazliddinorg/leetcode.git
cd leetcode
```

Navigate to a pattern folder and run any solution file:

```bash
cd "Hash Map-Hash Set"
python3 two_sum.py
```

## 🎯 Goal

* Strengthen problem-solving skills.
* Build a reference library of reusable algorithm patterns.
* Track progress on LeetCode systematically.
